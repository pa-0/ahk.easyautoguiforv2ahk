#  WARNING DONOT REPORT ISSUES REGARDING FEATURES or SAVING/IMPORTING GUIs

# **You may ask for ahkv2 specific features, functionality, or anything broken in the conversion process**

This is a mod of an existing app. Saving guis, importing, toolbars, or anything in the new feature realm will be closed. I will fix anything outside of those issues. There are people working on building a new version, I cannot now. 

This is a port of an existing application. It has limitations and I will not be expanding on the base features. Importing scripts does not work.
